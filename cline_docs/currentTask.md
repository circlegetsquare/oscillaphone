# Current Task: Architecture Improvement and Sound Integration

## Current Objectives
- Refactor BouncingCircles component for better maintainability
- Implement modular architecture with separation of concerns
- Enhance sound system with configurable parameters
- Ensure proper cleanup of audio and animation resources

## Context
This task relates to the following completed goals from projectRoadmap.md:
- Interactive physics-based animations
- Musical scale integration
- Dynamic sound generation
- Configurable animation parameters

## Recent Implementations
1. Architecture Improvements:
   - Modular component structure with clear separation of concerns
   - Custom hooks for specific functionality:
     - useAnimationState for GSAP animations
     - useCollisions for physics management
     - useColorPalette for color generation
   - AudioContext for centralized audio state management
   - Reusable UI components (Button, Slider, Checkbox, ControlPanel)
   - Fixed background animation persistence across component re-renders
   - Improved button hover animation with GSAP timelines and random colors
   - Ensured consistent animation style between container and button hover effects
   - Background animation persistence across re-renders

2. Sound System:
   - Web Audio API integration
   - Multiple musical scales (C Major, A Minor, F Lydian)
   - Stereo panning based on position
   - Configurable sound durations for collisions
   - Delay effect with configurable parameters
   - Reverb effect with configurable room size, damping, and mix
   - Distortion effect with configurable amount, oversample, and mix
   - Tremolo effect with configurable rate, depth, and mix
   - Separate controls for wall and circle collision sounds
   - Audio distortion prevention for multiple simultaneous sounds
   - Optimized volume levels for different collision types
   - Cooldown periods to prevent rapid-fire sound triggers

3. Animation Features:
   - Physics-based circle movements
   - Squish animations for collisions
   - GSAP timeline management
   - Proper cleanup on unmount

## Next Steps
1. Code Quality and Testing:
   - Add TypeScript for better type safety
   - Implement unit tests for critical components
   - Add prop validation with PropTypes
   - Consider adding ESLint rules for code quality
   - Browser compatibility testing for audio features
   - Performance profiling for animation-heavy scenes
   - Documentation for new audio effects

2. Sound System Enhancements:
   - Consider additional musical scales
   - Explore advanced audio features (filters, effects)
   - Optimize audio performance

3. Animation Improvements:
   - Add more interaction options
   - Enhance visual feedback
   - Consider particle effects for collisions

4. Performance Optimization:
   - Test across different browsers
   - Monitor performance with many circles
   - Implement React.memo for pure components
   - Consider using useCallback and useMemo for performance-critical functions

5. Documentation:
   - Update component API documentation
   - Add usage examples
   - Document sound configuration options
