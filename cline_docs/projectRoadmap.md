# Project Roadmap: GSAP + React Animation Project

## Project Goals
- [x] Set up a modern React application with GSAP integration
- [x] Create smooth, performant animations
- [x] Implement responsive and accessible animated components
- [x] Establish reusable animation patterns and hooks
- [x] Implement modular architecture with separation of concerns

## Key Features
- [x] Custom GSAP hook for React components
- [x] Interactive physics-based animations
- [x] Musical scale integration
- [x] Dynamic sound generation
- [x] Configurable animation parameters
- [x] Modular component architecture
- [ ] Additional animation patterns and components

## Completion Criteria
- All components render correctly and are responsive
- Animations perform smoothly without layout shifts
- Code is well-organized and follows React best practices
- GSAP animations are properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks
- Project follows accessibility guidelines
- Sound integration works consistently across browsers
- Components are modular with clear separation of concerns

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Initial project setup with Vite
- [x] GSAP and React dependencies installation
- [x] Project structure planning
- [x] Documentation setup
- [x] BouncingCircles component implementation
- [x] Physics-based collision system
- [x] Musical scale integration (C Major, A Minor, F Lydian)
- [x] Sound generation with Web Audio API
- [x] Stereo panning based on position
- [x] Configurable sound durations
- [x] Squish animations for collisions
- [x] Delay effect with configurable parameters
- [x] Reverb effect with configurable room size, damping, and mix
- [x] Distortion effect with configurable amount, oversample, and mix
- [x] Tremolo effect with configurable rate, depth, and mix
- [x] Improved button hover animation with GSAP timelines and random colors
- [x] Fixed background animation persistence across component re-renders
- [x] Refactored BouncingCircles into modular architecture
- [x] Created reusable UI components (Button, Slider, Checkbox, ControlPanel)
- [x] Implemented custom hooks for animation, physics, and colors
- [x] Added AudioContext for centralized audio state management
- [x] Separated audio controls by type (wall vs. circle collisions)
- [x] Fixed audio distortion when multiple sounds play simultaneously
- [x] Optimized volume levels for different collision types
- [x] Implemented cooldown periods to prevent rapid-fire sound triggers

## Future Scalability Considerations
- Additional musical scales and sound patterns
- More complex animation sequences
- Integration with route transitions
- Performance optimization for larger applications
- Component library expansion
- [x] Advanced audio features (filters, effects, etc.) - Added delay, reverb, distortion, and tremolo effects
- Additional animation patterns and components
- Performance optimization strategies
- [x] Modular architecture for better maintainability and extensibility
- [ ] TypeScript integration for better type safety
- [ ] Unit testing for critical components
